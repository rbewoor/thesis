All they saw him did. The dog 's fur was in his eyes. He was eating at a piece of meat. It was a large piece of meat -- it had been chopped up for dinner. It was the best piece of meat ever, and it was cold enough to touch. But it is cold and hard, for a dog is a prisoner. So they went on eating and eating and eating until there was nothing left but a lump of cold meat. They never stopped eating. The dog had become so hungry that he could not eat it. He was still panting. But what is the matter? The dog could not eat. Well, how he would hate to be starved. There he was eating, and the dog was panting, and the dog had not eaten. Why had the dog not eaten him? How he would hate to be starving. They were in the wood. There were no boys and girls on the road but the truck.
